          <h1>Nagpal Lab</h1>
          <p>We study microbiome–brain communication across development, with a focus on stress and social behaviour. Using zebrafish and C. elegans as scalable and mechanistic model organisms, and cross-species frameworks, our work integrates neurobiology, microbiome science, and environmental exposures.</p>
