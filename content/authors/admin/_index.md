I received my B.Sc.(Hons) in Biochemistry (First Class) from University of Delhi, India during which I was also a summer research fellow in the Evolutionary and Organismal Biology Unit at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India.

Thereafter, I was in Germany for over 10 years where I did my M.Sc. in Neuroscience (University of Göttingen / International Max Planck Research School), PhD specializing in optogenetics and nematode _C. elegans_ behaviour (University of Frankfurt), followed by a post-doc in Zebrafish stress neurobiology (MPI Heidelberg / University of Mainz).

I have been in Cork, Ireland since January 2020, first as an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland post-doctoral fellow at APC Microbiome Ireland, then as a lecturer at the Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, UCC. Since October 2024, I hold a permanent lectureship in Pharmacology and Therapeutics at UCC.

I am also a senior scientist at APC Microbiome Ireland and co-chair the UCC Race Equality Network. I serve as a director in the board of the ALBA Network and as the Science Communication Coordinator of the EU COST Action Affect-Evo.
